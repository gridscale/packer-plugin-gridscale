  The gridscale Packer builder is used to create new (os) templates for use with gridscale. The builder takes a template (in gridscale) or an iso-image, runs any provisioning necessary on the template/iso-image after launching it, then snapshots it into a reusable template. This reusable template can then be used as the foundation of new servers that are provisioned within gridscale user space.

# gridscale Builder

Type: `gridscale`
Artifact BuilderId: `packer.gridscale`

The `gridscale` Packer builder is used to create new (os) templates for use with [gridscale](https://www.gridscale.io/). The builder takes a template (in gridscale) or an iso-image, runs any provisioning necessary on the template/iso-image after launching it, then snapshots it into a reusable template. This reusable template can then be used as the foundation of new servers that are provisioned within gridscale user space.

The builder does _not_ manage templates. Once it creates a template, it is up to you
to use it or delete it.

### Installation

To install this plugin using Packer v1.7.0 or later, copy and paste this code
into your Packer configuration.

Then, run [`packer init`](https://www.packer.io/docs/commands/init).


```hcl
packer {
  required_plugins {
    gridscale = {
      version = ">= 0.0.1"
      source  = "github.com/gridscale/gridscale"
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration Reference

There are many configuration options available for the builder. They are
segmented below into two categories: required and optional parameters. Within
each category, the available configuration keys are alphabetized.

### Required:

@include 'builder/gridscale/Config-required.mdx'

### Optional:

@include 'builder/gridscale/Config-not-required.mdx'

## Basic Example

Here is a basic example. It is completely valid as soon as you enter your own `api_key` and `api_token` (or via environment variables `GRIDSCALE_UUID` and `GRIDSCALE_TOKEN`):
